# Horiseon Social Media Services - Code Refactoring Project

## Description

The purpose of this project was to update the code to follow accessbility guidelines to make the website more accessible to users and to improve site optimization for search engines. This project was built to improve my knowledge of HTML/CSS and how Semantic markup can assist with accessbility and SEO. The project has allowed me to update the code to make a clearer structure and a more efficient code base. In this project i learned the importance of considering the end user and the many ways in which users access the web.
